    1 small garlic clove

    1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
    1/4 teaspoon black pepper

    <h3>Cooks' notes:</h3>
    <ul>
        - The escargots can be prepared, but not baked, up to 30 minutes ahead and kept at room temperature until ready to bake.<br/>
        - If you don't have an escargot serving dish, serve the snails on a bed of kosher salt (to stabilize shells) on a platter.
    </ul>
<h3>Serves 6 people</h3>
